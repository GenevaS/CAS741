## The Companion Cube Calculator ##

This is the project directory for the Companion Cube Calculator (C^3), a 
mathematical tool which determines the range of a user-specified function given 
the domains of the function's variables. The calculations are performed using 
interval arithmetic.

The repository for this project is organized as:

1. Doc: Problem Statement, Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Design/Module Guide (MG), 
Design/Module Interface Specification (MIS), Test Plan, Test Report, and User Guide
2. ReferenceMaterial: Supporting research and resources
3. src: The implementation of the Companion Cube Calculator that resulted from the documentation
